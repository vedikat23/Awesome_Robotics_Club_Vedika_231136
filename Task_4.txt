I gained interest in Robotics since my participation in Takneek.The idea of creating a robot is intriguing in itself and seems pretty cool.The gyrobot's ability to maintain perfect equilibrium while in motion is both impressive and captivating. Working hands on to build something used in real time seems like an opportunity that shouldn't be missed.
